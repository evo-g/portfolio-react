        Hi, my name is Evodio Garcia! I am a San Diego native who grew up in East County. I speak Spanish and English. Iâ€™m a mechanic turned software developer, who went from
        breaking down cars to breaking down code. Working with my hands is not new to me now I aim to take it to new frontiers
        in my life. I am new to software devolopment,
        but not new to project building. I have always enjoyed building things, as a child I always took my toys
        apart and was facinated by how things worked, later it turned into building project cars. Which took me to
        an automotive trade school where I learned the ins and outs of a car. Now I am interested in making websites,
        web applications, servers, creating databases, and whatever else I can create with Javascript. My education
        came from Origin Code Academy, and also have associates degrees for business and technologies, business and
        economics, and business administration. I have been busy the majority of my life learning different trades
        and skills, but with web devolopment I find myself really seeing a future I look forward too. I picked up and
        learned many lessons along the way of my journey, and I feel I can be an asset to any company or group.
